## We use Material UI as our framework
Do not override the styles. Change it using the theme provided. Go to:
``` .storybook > preview.js > theme ```  and change the theme as you need.

**To know more about what you can change: [visit the docs.](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/)**

## How to create a component

Go to: 

``` src >  stories > components``` and start to write yours.

Each component needs a *stories.tsx* file in order to render it on the storybook.

See the example using the **button** component.
